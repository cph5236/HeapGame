## FEATURES

- Play Integrity API
Deferred 2026-08-12 — see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-run-session-tokens-design.md
Integrity only verifies the Play-installed Android build, but web and itch.io are
first-class platforms, so an attacker who fails it just uses the web build and is
indistinguishable from a legitimate web player. It closes APK modification while
leaving the cheapest attack (a single curl to /scores) untouched. Run-session
tokens were built instead — platform-agnostic, and they close the actual hole.
Revisit only if a verified-Android leaderboard tier becomes a product goal.
